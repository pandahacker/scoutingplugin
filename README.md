# Scouting Plugin
A RuneLite plugin for automatically scouting for various events as you encounter them. Events will be processed and
posted to the Log Hunters discord (https://discord.gg/loghunters).

The plugin will automatically scout for various event types and report the events to the server, if you have enabled
connection to the server and that specific event type. No additional effort is required on your part!

Make sure to enable each event type in the plugin settings if you want to contribute!

- For now, we only support scouting for a few Forestry events.
- Many other events (implings, shooting stars, etc.) may be added in the future!
